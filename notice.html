    <p>This site is purely a meme, there is no functionality of signing up, and actually 'finding love' not that love
    exists anyway. The site does not have any connection to Blizzard Entertainment or Overwatch. If you want to find
    love as a hanzo main then go to eHarmony or OKCupid or some other shit like that. </p>
