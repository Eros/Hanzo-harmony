    <h1>Read me before you get salty</h1>
    <p>This site is purely a meme, there is no functionality of signing up, and actually 'finding love' not that love
    exists anyway. The site does not have any connection to Blizzard Entertainment or Overwatch. If you want to find
    love as a hanzo main then go to eHarmony or OKCupid or some other shit like that. If you're actually here thinking
    that this site is real then sorry I'm just joking around. As well as the source code is public available via GitHub.
    If you got a problem with the site then sue me.</p>
